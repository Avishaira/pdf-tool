Legal Information & Privacy Policy
Last Updated: February 2026

1. The "Serverless" Promise (Privacy)
PDF Master operates on a client-side basis. This is a crucial distinction from other online tools:

Your files are processed entirely within your web browser using WebAssembly technology.
Your documents are NEVER uploaded to our servers. We technically cannot see them.
Once you close the tab, all data regarding your session is wiped from your browser's memory.
2. Data Collection (Cookies & Analytics)
While we do not collect your documents, we use third-party services to keep this tool free and functional:

Google Analytics: We collect anonymous, aggregated data about traffic (e.g., "100 visitors today") to understand site performance.
Google AdSense: We display advertisements. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to this website or other websites.
You can opt-out of personalized advertising by visiting Google Ads Settings.

3. Terms of Service
By using PDF Master, you agree to the following:

"As Is" Warranty: This service is provided free of charge. We are not responsible for any data loss, formatting errors, or issues resulting from the use of this tool. Always verify your output files.
Lawful Use: You agree not to use this service for any illegal purposes or to manipulate documents you do not have the right to edit.
